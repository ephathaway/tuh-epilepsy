# tuh-epilepsy

Using a convolutional neural net to predict epilepsy diagnoses from patient EEG recordings.

### Dataset

The CNN is trained on EEG data from the [Temple University EEG Corpus](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/overview.shtml), which is a collection of EEGs freely available to the public. We use EEGs from patients diagnosed with epilepsy and patients diagnosed with no epilepsy in their patient chart.
